## About
This is wewebigboys entry for the GMTK Game Jam 2020. The project is an asteroids-like arcade game built using Unity and C# in 48 hours. 
All of the code, Unity stuff, icons and music was done in this time. The 3D assets come from the wonderful people at [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/). 
The game can be played over at [itch.io](wewebigboys.itch.io/cyber-asteroid).


## The Game

You play as brave cyber-spaceship pilot Gunnlaug. Your mission is to survive in the asteroid field for as long as possible. The asteroids can break systems on your ship, leaving you out of control of your spacecraft. Luckily for you HQ has sent out cyber-turkeys to help you repair your ship. Look for alien artefacts such as cyber-easter-island-heads or cyber-bombs as they may aid you in your mission.
Good luck!


## Controls
